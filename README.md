screen-powerline
================

A [vim-powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) inspired config for GNU Screen.

It requires a font patched for vim-powerline. A list of patched fonts can be found at the
[vim-powerline Wiki](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/wiki/Patched-fonts).

**This won't work most of the time because of crappy utf8 support in screen.
It might be a better idea to use tmux instead.**
